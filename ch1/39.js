/*
A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in
1770 by the German math- ematician J.H. Lambert:
tan(x) = x / (1 - x ^ 2 / (3 - x ^ 2 / (5 - ...)))
where x is in radians. Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an
approximation to the tangent function based on Lambertâ€™s formula. k specifies
the number of terms to compute, as in Exercise 1.37.
