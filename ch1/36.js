/*
Modify fixed-point so that it prints the sequence of approximations it
generates, using the newline and display primitives shown in Exercise 1.22.
Then find a solution to x ^ x = 1000 by finding a fixed point of
x -> log(1000)/ log(x). (Use Schemeâ€™s primitive log procedure, which computes
natural logarithms.) Compare the number of steps this takes with and without
average damping. (Note that you cannot start fixed-point with a guess of 1, as
this would cause division by log(1) = 0.)
