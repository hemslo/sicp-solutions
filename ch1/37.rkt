; a. An infinite continued fraction is an expression of the form
; f = N1/(D1 + N2 / (D2 + N3/ (D3 + ... )))
; As an example, one can show that the infinite continued fraction expansion
; with the Ni and the Di all equal to 1 produces 1/φ, where φ is the golden
; ratio (described in Section 1.2.2). One way to approximate an infinite
; continued fraction is to truncate the expansion after a given number of terms.
; Such a truncation — a so-called k-term finite continued fraction—has the form
; N1 / (D1 + N2 / (... + Nk/ Dk))
; Suppose that n and d are procedures of one argument (the term index i) that
; return the Ni and Di of the terms of the continued fraction. Define a
; procedure cont-frac such that evaluating (cont-frac n d k) computes the value
; of the k-term finite continued fraction. Check your procedure by approximating
; 1/φ using

;(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
;           (lambda (i) 1.0)
;           k)

; for successive values of k. How large must you make k in order to get an
; approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal places?
; b. If your cont-frac procedure generates a recursive process, write one that
; generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write
; one that generates a recursive process.

(define (cont-frac n d k)
  (define (iter i result)
    (if (= 0 i)
        result
        (iter (- i 1)
              (/ (n i)
                 (+ (d i) result)))))
  (iter k 0))

(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           11)


(define (cont-frac-recur n d k)
    (define (recur i)
        (if (> i k)
            0
            (/ (n i)
               (+ (d i) (recur (+ i 1))))))
    (recur 1))
