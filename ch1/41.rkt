; Define a procedure double that takes a procedure of one argument as argument
; and returns a procedure that applies the original procedure twice. For
; example, if inc is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument, then (double inc)
; should be a procedure that adds 2. What value is returned by
; (((double (double double)) inc) 5)

(define (inc x)

(define (double f)
  (lambda (x)
