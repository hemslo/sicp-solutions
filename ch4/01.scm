; Notice that we cannot tell whether the metacircular evaluator evaluates
; operands from left to right or from right to left. Its evaluation order is
; inherited from the underlying Lisp: If the arguments to cons in list-of-values
; are evaluated from left to right, then list-of-values will evaluate operands
; from left to right; and if the arguments to cons are evaluated from right to
; left, then list-of-values will evaluate operands from right to left.
; Write a version of list-of-values that evaluates operands from left to right
; regardless of the order of evaluation in the underlying Lisp. Also write a
; version of list-of-values that evaluates operands from right to left.
