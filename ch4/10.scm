; By using data abstraction, we were able to write an eval procedure that is
; independent of the particular syntax of the language to be evaluated. To
; illustrate this, design and implement a new syntax for Scheme by modifying the
; procedures in this section, without changing eval or apply.

; if want ot modify set!
; only need to modify assignment? and eval-assignment.
