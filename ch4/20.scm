; Because internal definitions look sequential but are actually simultaneous,
; some people prefer to avoid them entirely, and use the special form letrec
; instead. letrec looks like let, so it is not surprising that the variables it
; binds are bound simultaneously and have the same scope as each other. The
; sample procedure f above can be written without internal definitions, but with
; exactly the same meaning, as

;(define (f x)
;  (letrec
;    ((even? (lambda (n)
;             (if (= n 0) true (odd? (- n 1)))))
;     (odd? (lambda (n)
;             (if (= n 0) false (even? (- n 1))))))
;  ⟨rest of body of f⟩))

; letrec expressions, which have the form

;(letrec ((⟨var1⟩ ⟨exp1⟩) . . . (⟨varn⟩ ⟨expn⟩))
;  ⟨body⟩)

; are a variation on let in which the expressions ⟨expk⟩ that provide the
; initial values for the variables ⟨vark⟩ are evaluated in an environment that
; includes all the letrec bindings. This permits recursion in the bindings, such
; as the mutual recursion of even? and odd? in the example above, or the
; evaluation of 10 factorial with

;(letrec
;  ((fact (lambda (n)
;           (if (= n 1) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))))
;  (fact 10))

; a. Implement letrec as a derived expression, by transforming a letrec
; expression into a let expression as shown in the text above or in Exercise
; 4.18. That is, the letrec variables should be created with a let and then be
; assigned their values with set!.

; b. Louis Reasoner is confused by all this fuss about internal definitions. The
; way he sees it, if you don’t like to use define inside a procedure, you can
; just use let. Illustrate what is loose about his reasoning by drawing an
; environment diagram that shows the environment in which the
; ⟨rest of body of f⟩ is evaluated during evaluation of the expression (f 5),
; with f defined as in this exercise. Draw an environment diagram for the same
; evaluation, but with let in place of letrec in the definition of f.
