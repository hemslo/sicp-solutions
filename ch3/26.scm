; To search a table as implemented above, one needs to scan through the list of
; records. This is basically the unordered list representation of Section 2.3.3.
; For large tables, it may be more efficient to structure the table in a
; different manner. Describe a table implementation where the (key, value)
; records are organized using a binary tree, assuming that keys can be ordered
; in some way (e.g., numerically or alphabetically). (Compare Exercise 2.66 of
; Chapter 2.)

; Change tree node to (key value), order by key
