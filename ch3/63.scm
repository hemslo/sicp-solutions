; Louis Reasoner asks why the sqrt-stream procedure was not written in the
; following more straight-forward way, without the local variable guesses:

(define (sqrt-stream x)
  (cons-stream 1.0
               (stream-map (lambda (guess) (sqrt-improve guess x))
                           (sqrt-stream x))))

; Alyssa P. Hacker replies that this version of the procedure is considerably
; less efficient because it performs redundant computation. Explain Alyssa’s
; answer. Would the two versions still differ in efficiency if our
; implementation of delay used only (lambda () ⟨exp⟩) without using the
; optimization provided by memo-proc (Section 3.5.1)?


; (sqrt-stream x) will recompute every time.
; No.
