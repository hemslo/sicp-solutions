; Use the results of Exercise 3.60 and Exercise 3.61 to define a procedure
; div-series that divides two power series. div-series should work for any two
; series, provided that the denominator series begins with a nonzero constant
; term. (If the denominator has a zero constant term, then div-series should
; signal an error.) Show how to use div-series together with the result of
; Exercise 3.59 to generate the power series for tangent.
