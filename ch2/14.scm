; After considerable work, Alyssa P. Hacker delivers her finished system.
; Several years later, after she has forgotten all about it, she gets a frenzied
; call from an irate user, Lem E. Tweakit. It seems that Lem has noticed that
; the formula for parallel resistors can be written in two algebraically
; equivalent ways:
; (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)
; and
; 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2)
; He has written the following two programs, each of which computes the
; parallel-resistors formula differently:

;(define (par1 r1 r2)
;  (div-interval (mul-interval r1 r2)
;                (add-interval r1 r2)))
;
;(define (par2 r1 r2)
;  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
;    (div-interval
;     one (add-interval (div-interval one r1)
;                       (div-interval one r2)))))

; Lem complains that Alyssaâ€™s program gives different answers for the two ways
; of computing. This is a serious complaint.

; Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a
; variety of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals A and B, and use them
; in computing the expressions A/A and A/B. You will get the most insight by
; using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine
; the results of the computation in center-percent form (see Exercise 2.12).
