; As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects
; or new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies—generic
; operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and
; message-passing-style—describe the changes that must be made to a system in
; order to add new types or new operations. Which organization would be most
; appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which would
; be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?

; new types -> message-passing-style
; new operations -> data-directed
